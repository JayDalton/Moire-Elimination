# DICOM Moire-Elimination

This project tries to implement **A new stationary gridline artifact suppression method based on the 2D discrete wavelet transform** for given DICOM files. It's article can be found under [ResearchGate.net](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/274399694_A_new_stationary_gridline_artifact_suppression_method_based_on_the_2D_discrete_wavelet_transform).
